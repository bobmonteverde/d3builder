D3Builder

This project is in it's very infancy, still working oncleaning up the code structure, figuring out what to name things, and eventually how to style things.  In the meantime, the primary goal is to get all the basic intial functionality working, once complete, will work out the short and long term goals of the application.

The initial goal of this tool, is to allow web developers to create data visualizations in d3.js (and possibly other libraries... tho the primary functionality I don't plan to stray from is that this tool will concentrate on building web based data visualizations).  The initial planned functionality will be to have a simple collaborative code editor and chat system.  While I know this has been done before, and I don't think this will ever be a better all around collaborative code editor, I do plan on building out additional functionality specific to data visualization, as well as promoting collaboration by providing an easy way to ask for help, as well as see who need help, so other users can attempt to share the expertise.  THe goal is to have this in both real time as well as over longer periods of time (the chat system is intended to become a cross between a chat room and a comments system... in the end, there really is little difference between the two, aside of expectations of how quickly you may receive help, whch will for the most part be out of my hands).

I have a number of other goals in mind, I will work on explaining them later on, and hopefully will receive feedback on what people may want to see first.

And finally, while I have not chosen a specific license to release this code under, I plan to in the near future... it will absolutely always be open source, free to use, modify, and hopefully contribute back to the core repository.  Any and all contributions are very welcome and appreciated.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
